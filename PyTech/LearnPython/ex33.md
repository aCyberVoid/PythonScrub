# Exercise 33. While Loops
### Definition

[*While* loops](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop), like the [ForLoop](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop), are used for repeating sections of code - but unlike a *for* loop, the *while* loop will not run *n* times, but until a defined condition is no longer met (no longer True). If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not be executed at all.

> ⚠️ NOTE
>
> *While-loops sometimes do not stop. It's great if needed, but if not, there are some rules to follow to prevent this behavior.*
>
> 1. Make sure that you use while-loops sparingly. Usually a for-loop is better
> 2. Review your while statements and make sure that the boolean test will become False at some point
> 3. When in doubt, print out your test variable at the top and bottom of the while-loop to see what it's doing
### Syntax

```python
while condition:
    body of while loop containing code that does something
```
##### Example

```python
# Initialize variable 'i' to 0
i = 0
# Initialize an empty list called 'numbers'
numbers = []

while i < 6:

    # Print the value of 'i' at the beginning of each iteration
    print(f"At the top i is {i}")

    # Append the value of 'i' to the 'numbers' list
    numbers.append(i)

    # Increment the value of 'i' by 1
    i += 1

    # Print the current state of the 'numbers' list
    print("Numbers now: ", numbers)

    # Print the value of 'i' at the end of each iteration
    print(f"At the bottom i is {i}")

print("The numbers: ")

for num in numbers:

    # Print the value of 'num' (individual elements of the list)
    print(num)
```
##### Output

```plaintext
At the top i is 0
Numbers now:  [0]
At the bottom i is 1
At the top i is 1
Numbers now:  [0, 1]
At the bottom i is 2
At the top i is 2
Numbers now:  [0, 1, 2]
At the bottom i is 3
At the top i is 3
Numbers now:  [0, 1, 2, 3]
At the bottom i is 4
At the top i is 4
Numbers now:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
At the bottom i is 5
At the top i is 5
Numbers now:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
At the bottom i is 6
The numbers:
0
1
2
3
4
5
```
### Drills

1. Convert this while-loop to a function that you can call, and replace 6 in the test (i < 6) with a variable.
```python
# Initialize an empty list called 'numbers'  
numbers = []  
  
  
def my_loop(limit):  
# Initialize variable 'i' to 0  
i = 0  
while i < limit:  
# Print the value of 'i' at the beginning of each iteration  
print(f"At the top i is {i}")  
  
# Append the value of 'i' to the 'numbers' list  
numbers.append(i)  
  
# Increment the value of 'i' by 1  
i += 1  
  
# Print the current state of the 'numbers' list  
print("Numbers now: ", numbers)  
  
# Print the value of 'i' at the end of each iteration  
print(f"At the bottom i is {i}")  
  
  
my_loop(6)  
# Print the final state of the 'numbers' list  
print("The numbers: ")  
  
for num in numbers:  
# Print the value of 'num' (individual elements of the list)  
print(num)
```
2. Use this function to rewrite the script to try different numbers. 
```python
# Initialize an empty list called 'numbers'  
numbers = []  
  
  
def my_loop(limit):  
# Initialize variable 'i' to 0  
i = 0  
while i < limit:  
# Print the value of 'i' at the beginning of each iteration  
print(f"At the top i is {i}")  
  
# Append the value of 'i' to the 'numbers' list  
numbers.append(i)  
  
# Increment the value of 'i' by 1  
i += 1  
  
# Print the current state of the 'numbers' list  
print("Numbers now: ", numbers)  
  
# Print the value of 'i' at the end of each iteration  
print(f"At the bottom i is {i}")  
  
  
my_loop(9)  
# Print the final state of the 'numbers' list  
print("The numbers: ")  
  
for num in numbers:  
# Print the value of 'num' (individual elements of the list)  
print(num)
```
3-4. Add another variable to the function arguments that you can pass in that lets you change the `+ 1` on line 8 so you can change how much it increments by. Rewrite the script to use this function to see what effect that has.
```python
# Initialize an empty list called 'numbers'  
numbers = []  
  
  
def my_loop(limit, increment):  
# Initialize variable 'i' to 0  
i = 0  
while i < limit:  
# Print the value of 'i' at the beginning of each iteration  
print(f"At the top i is {i}")  
  
# Append the value of 'i' to the 'numbers' list  
numbers.append(i)  
  
# Increment the value of 'i' by 1  
i += increment  
  
# Print the current state of the 'numbers' list  
print("Numbers now: ", numbers)  
  
# Print the value of 'i' at the end of each iteration  
print(f"At the bottom i is {i}")  
  
  
my_loop(100, 10)  
# Print the final state of the 'numbers' list  
print("The numbers: ")  
  
for num in numbers:  
# Print the value of 'num' (individual elements of the list)  
print(num)
```
5. Write the script to use a `for-loops` and `range`. Do you need the incrementor in the middle anymore? What happens if you do not get rid of it?
```python
# Initialize an empty list called 'numbers'  
numbers = []  
  
  
def my_loop(limit):  
# Initialize variable 'i' to 0  
# i = 0  
for i in range(0, limit, 10):  
# Print the value of 'i' at the beginning of each iteration  
print(f"At the top i is {i}")  
  
# Append the value of 'i' to the 'numbers' list  
numbers.append(i)  
  
# Increment the value of 'i' by 1  
# i += 1  
  
# Print the current state of the 'numbers' list  
print("Numbers now: ", numbers)  
  
# Print the value of 'i' at the end of each iteration  
print(f"At the bottom i is {i}")  
  
  
my_loop(101)  
# Print the final state of the 'numbers' list  
print("The numbers: ")  
  
for num in numbers:  
# Print the value of 'num' (individual elements of the list)  
print(num)
```
