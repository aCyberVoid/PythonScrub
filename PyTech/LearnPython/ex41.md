### Practice

1. Drill these on paper using flash cards. If you get any wrong, write down what you get wrong and make sure you get them right next time (no cheating!).
2. Practice these on your terminal. Run `python3 ex41_oop_test.py . py english` to test your knowledge. Take note of what you get wrong.
