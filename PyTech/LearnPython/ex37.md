## Reading Code

Find code you like and read it. <http://github.com> Is a good place for this.
First print it out and go through it line by line. Break each line down to 
what every symbol and word does. If you find symbols or words you don't know,
research them. 

Take notes on the following:

1. Functions and what they do.
2. Where each variable is first given a value.
3. Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program. These
   are especially tricky.
4. Any if-statements without else clauses. Are they right?
5. Any while-loops that might not end.
6. Write comments above lines you don't understand.
