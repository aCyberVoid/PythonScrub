> Instructions
>
> In this exercise, you will take the logic exercises you memorized and start
> trying them out in Python. Take each of these logic problems and write what
> you think the answer will be. In each case it will be either True or False.
> Once you have the answers written down, you will start Python in your
> terminal and type each logic problem in to confirm your answers.
