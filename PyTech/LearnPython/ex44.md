# Exercise 44: Inheritence vs Composition

## What is Inheritence?

Inheritance allows one class to inherit features from another class. It lets you reuse common functionality defined in a parent class (Bar) and specialize it in a child class (Foo).

For example, if you have a class called "Bar" and you create a new class called "Foo" like this: "class Foo(Bar)", it means that the class "Foo" inherits from the class "Bar". This relationship between the two classes is implicit in the code.

```python
class Bar:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Bar!")

class Foo(Bar):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Foo!")
  
    def special_greet(self):
        print("Hello from Foo! I'm specialized!")

foo_instance = Foo()
foo_instance.greet()  # Output: "Hello from Foo!"
foo_instance.special_greet()  # Output: "Hello from Foo! I'm specialized!"
```

In this case, when we define the `Foo` class as `class Foo(Bar)`, it means that `Foo` inherits from `Bar`. This relationship is indicated by the `(Bar)` part.

By inheriting from `Bar`, the `Foo` class gains access to all the attributes and methods defined in `Bar`. This includes the `greet` method in the `Bar` class.

When we create an instance of the `Foo` class (`foo_instance = Foo()`), it can call the `greet` method. Since `Foo` inherits from `Bar`, the `greet` method from `Bar` is available in `Foo`. So when we call `foo_instance.greet()`, it invokes the `greet` method defined in `Foo`, but if it doesn't find it in `Foo`, it automatically looks for it in the parent class `Bar` and executes the method from there.

This way, the `Foo` class inherits the behavior of the `Bar` class, and we can utilize and override the inherited methods as needed.

Another example of Foo(Bar) inheriting from Bar() is if `def greet(self)` did not exist for `foo_instance.greet()` based on what I described above:

```python
class Bar:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Bar!")

class Foo(Bar):
    def special_greet(self):
        print("Hello from Foo! I'm specialized!")

foo_instance = Foo()
foo_instance.greet()  # Output: "Hello from Bar!"
foo_instance.special_greet()  # Output: "Hello from Foo! I'm specialized!"
```

In this case, Foo(Bar) did not have its own `greet` method, so it then in turn went to Bar() to get that method and print out its statement "Hello from Bar!"

## Parent Child Class Interactions

### Implicit Inheritence

**Actions on the child imply an action on the parent**

```python
class Parent():
    def implicit(self):
        print("PARENT implicit()")  # Define a method named implicit in the Parent class

class Child(Parent):
    pass  # Create a Child class that inherits from the Parent class without adding any additional methods

dad = Parent()  # Create an instance of the Parent class
son = Child()  # Create an instance of the Child class
dad.implicit()  # Call the implicit method on the dad object (Parent class)
son.implicit()  # Call the implicit method on the son object (Child class)
```

**Actions on the child override the action on the parent**

```python
class Parent():
    def override(self):
        print("PARENT override()")  # Define a method named override in the Parent class

class Child(Parent):
    def override(self):
        print("CHILD override")  # Define a method named override in the Child class

dad = Parent()  # Create an instance of the Parent class
son = Child()  # Create an instance of the Child class
dad.override()  # Call the override method on the dad object (Parent class)
son.override()  # Call the override method on the son object (Child class)
```

**Actions on the child alter the action on the parent**

```python
class Parent(object):
    def altered(self):
        print("PARENT altered")

class Child(Parent):
    def altered(self):
        print("CHILD, BEFORE PARENT altered")
        super(Child, self).altered()  # Call the altered method of the Parent class
        print("CHILD, AFTER PARENT altered")

dad = Parent()  # Create an instance of the Parent class
son = Child()  # Create an instance of the Child class
dad.altered()  # Call the altered method on the dad object (Parent class)
son.altered()  # Call the altered method on the son object (Child class)
```
