# Exercise 32. Loops and Lists

The `for` loop iterates over a sequence such as lists, tuple, strings, or any iterable object. [^1]

### Syntax

```python
for element in sequence:
    # for statement code block
```

- the variable `iterator_var` takes the value of the item inside a sequence.
- the `sequence` is the code block where the loop will be iterated
- `statement(s)` is the block of code that will be executed on each iteration of the loop

##### Example

```python
# Create a list of numbers
the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a list of fruits
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'apricots']

# Create a list with mixed types of data
change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

# This first kind of for-loop goes through a list
# Iterates over each element in the_count list and prints a message
for num in the_count:
    print(f"This is count {num}")

# Same as above
# Iterates over each element in fruits list and prints a message
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"A fruit of type: {fruit}")

# Also, we can go through mixed lists too
# Notice we have to use {} since we don't know what's in it
# Iterates over each element in the change list and prints it
for i in change:
    print(f"I got {i}")

# We can also build lists, first start with an empty one
# Create an empty list called elements
elements = []

# Then use the range function to do 0 to 5 counts
# Iterates over a sequence of numbers from 0 to 5
for i in range(0, 6):
    print(f"Adding {i} to the list.")
    # Append is a function that lists understand
    # Adds the current number to the elements list
    elements.append(i)

# Now we can print them out too
# Iterates over each element in the elements list and prints it
for i in elements:
    print(f"Element was: {i}")

```

##### Output

```python
This is count 1
This is count 2
This is count 3
This is count 4
This is count 5
A fruit of type: apples
A fruit of type: oranges
A fruit of type: pears
A fruit of type: apricots
I got 1
I got pennies
I got 2
I got dimes
I got 3
I got quarters
Adding 0 to the list.
Adding 1 to the list.
Adding 2 to the list.
Adding 3 to the list.
Adding 4 to the list.
Adding 5 to the list.
Element was: 0
Element was: 1
Element was: 2
Element was: 3
Element was: 4
Element was: 5
```

### Drills

1. The `range()` function in Python is commonly used in `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers. It allows you to specify the starting point, the ending point (exclusive), and the step size for the sequence.[^2]

Example:

```python
for i in range(0, 6):
    print(f"Adding {i} to the list.")
    elements.append(i)
```

The `range(0, 6)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, 6. This means the loop will iterate over the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

During each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` represents the current number in the sequence. In this case, it will take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Within the loop, the code prints a message indicating the number being added to the list using an f-string (`print(f"Adding {i} to the list.")`). It then appends the current value of `i` to the `elements` list using the `append()` function.

So, after the loop completes, the `elements` list will contain the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, in that order.

2. On line 32, I could have acoided the for-loop and directly assign the result of `range(0, 6)` to the `elements` list.

Modified Version:

```python
# Assign the result of range(0, 6) directly to the elements list
elements = list(range(0, 6))

for i in elements:
    print(f"Element was: {i}")
```

I directly assigned `list(range(0, 6))` to the `elements` list. By using `list()` we convert the range into a list.

3. Besides `append()` there are a few commonly used operations and methods for lists [^3]:
   1. `len()` to get the length of a list
   2. `Concatenation` to add more to a list
   3. `remove()` to remove elements from a list, `insert()` to insert elements into a list, `extend()` to append multiple elements from another iterable
