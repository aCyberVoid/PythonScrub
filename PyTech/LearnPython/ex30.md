# Exercise 30. Else and If

Using the concepts of if statments, we can now make programs that decide what to do based on some conditions. In this exercise, we will learn how to use the `else` and `elif` keywords to make more complex decisions.

```python
people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

if cars > people:
    print("We should take the cars.")
elif cars < people:
    print("We should not take the cars.")
else:
    print("We can not decide")

if trucks > cars:
    print("That's too many trucks. Where did they come from!?")
elif trucks < cars:
    print("Maybe we could take the trucks instead.")
else:
    print("We still can't decide.")

if people > trucks:
    print(Alright, let's just take the trucks!")
else:
    print("FINE! I give up. Let's stay home since we can't decide!")
```

- Python will onyl run the first True return, even if multiple exist in the code block under the statements
- `elif` - short for "else if" - allows you to check multiple conditions sequentially after the inital "if" statement. It will run until the first True is returned
- `else` - a default block of code that executes when none of the preceeding conditions in the :if" and "elif" statements are True
