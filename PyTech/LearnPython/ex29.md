Exmaple of the if-statement

```python
people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15

if people < cats:
    print("Too many cats! The world is doomed!")
if people > cats:
    print("Not many cats! The world is saved!")
if people < dogs:
    print("The world will be drooled on!")
if people > dogs:
    print("The world is dry!")

dogs += 5

if people >= dogs:
    print("The amount of people are greater than or equal to dogs.")
if people <= dogs:
    print("The amount of people is less than or equal to dogs.")
if people == dogs:
    print("We the people are dogs.")
```

* The `if` statment checks to see if the two variables we are comparing are True or False
* The code under the `if` statement must be indented as it defines blocks of codes that belongs to a particular control structure [if statments, loops, function definitions]
* You will get a IndentationError if proper indentations are not present in your code
