# PythonScrub
This repository is a showcase of my journey as I learn the Python programming language. In this repository, you will find code snippets, exercises, and projects that I have worked on during this journey.

### ↪ Getting Started
I recommend starting off with Python's official [Beginner's Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide). It comes with a lot of useful information for those looking how to get started and provides different resources and tools to help you learn Python.

### ↪ Installation
Python works with various operating systems. You can go to Python's [Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page and download the language based on the instructions for your oerpating system.
