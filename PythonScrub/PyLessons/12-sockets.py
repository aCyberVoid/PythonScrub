# In Python, a socket is a low-level networking interface that allows your computer to send and receive data over a network. Sockets are used to build many different types of networked applications, such as web servers, FTP clients, and instant messaging programs.

#import socket
# Loopback address / Home Address
#HOST = '127.0.0.1'
#PORT = 7777


# make a connection to the host using the specified port
# AF_INET is IPv4
# SOCK_STREAM is a port
#s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#s.connect((HOST,PORT))
